(*

Would like to write

type r = ⟪x : int; y : int⟫

let s  = {⟪x = 1; y = 2⟫; ⟪x = 1; y = 1⟫}
let s' = {⟪r with y = 1⟫ | ∀ (r ∈ s)}

intead of

type r = <|x : int; y : int|>

let s  = {<|x = 1; y = 2|>; <|x = 1; y = 1|>}
let s' = {<|r with y = |> | forall (r IN s) | true}

since

let s' = Set`map (fun r -> <|r with r.x = 1|>) s

is just as short.
